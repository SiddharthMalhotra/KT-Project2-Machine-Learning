328434766871412736	Y	First day of reduction back down to normal dose of lamotrigine-before I could literally feel it irritating my nerve endings
328464211007111171	Y	Ok brain & body. We need a chat about oversleeping and overeating since taking Olanzapine again #tuboficecream #timetochange #junkfood #gym
328529078753845248	Y	Reducing the lamotrigine is grim. Exhausted and grumpy. Got another 2 weeks of this yet. Wondering if I'm doing the right thing?
328616992858853377	Y	Why does tapering down lamotrigine feel as yucky as stepping it up? #soreashell

330406681496395777	Y	Only problem is the ride has fuelled the olanzapine munchies. I was a nightmare in the supermarket tonight!
330466694189428737	Y	@KieraRampton It's called lamotrigine, I'm pretty sure the mix of them both is making me sick. I don't think bipolar & ADD mix very well..

332450567819497472	Y	@KarimS3D Olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much
332457979939016705	Y	@DoctorChristian is my memory really bad due to 900mg seroquel and 120mg cymbalta or the bipolar itself? I'm not remembering conversations
332497216080052224	Y	olanzapine is supposed to make you a fat bastard i got off lucky. lithium makes my hand shake. bipolar or schizo drugs.
332511485043548162	Y	I'd rather be on the Effexor that made me happy though I had severe back pain from it.. Than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....

332754231138320384	Y	Why seroquel can make me put on 20 over kg: it acts like an insulin blocker or something.
332778502946426880	Y	@jessindia I take fluoxetine and quetiapine. The quetiapine is the one with the massive sleepies, althouth the flouxetine doesn''t help.
332975105347035136	Y	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
332988218192588800	Y	@RipnerCabbit @pacerfox Ugh. My partner was on Paxil for a while. It made him hide in the apartment. :/
332990941629657088	Y	@_cimmy_ thanks! yes, after I was prescribed Cipro a few years ago, and it REALLY messed me up, I am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
333037072992575490	Y	@Basic_Chunnel @bromethazine I'm pretty lucid in all my dreams, and the Seroquel drowsiness carried over into the dream. LOLOL.
333194880765546496	Y	I've decided I'm really not happy with the pain lamotrigine is causing or the poor sleep. I am thinking of asking for a trial of Prozac and
333197031659167746	Y	Does anyone know if the #weight gain is less in #olanzapine combined with #Prozac(#symbyax) than in olanzapine alone?
333199163514843137	Y	@bipolarblogger The misery I'm experiencing today from the pain, outweighs the anti-depressant effect of the lamotrigine
333203009209266176	Y	I can only get about 7-8 hours of sleep on my own. But I got at least 16 hours with Seroquel. I now see how people can get addicted.

333286778628870145	Y	@MondaysMomma It's ok, I guess it's just a case of trial and error with antidepressants. Coming off venlafaxine has been so nasty :(

333854639332151296	Y	@iamcarrieeeeee Coming off the lamotrigine. It's not acceptable to be in pain most of the time. Struggled to get out of the bath on sat

334024264187523074	Y	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
336982086747561986	Y	@FriarDanny I appreciate it. I gained over 30lbs with Paxil so I'm trying something different, tired of the appetite side effects.

340530953015402497	Y	@ItsMeCreezy I hate to hear that. Taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
340567278422728704	Y	Took a percocet for my tooth. Feel like I'm about to die cause of the Prozac thats already in my system. Apparently you can't take both. FML

342222086913261568	Y	@Azlemed first two weeks of olanzapine v drowsy. weight gain was an issue. Great for my anxiety though.

342267623758782464	Y	@Fatuglyew thing about venlafaxine is the withdrawals when you're late for a dose - it's like electric shocks in your brain, and they go -

342646731856572416	Y	I shouldn't tweet on vyvanse it's going to be extremely negative lol
342662725165543426	Y	People taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? Cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
342671774519009280	Y	But still Dr. Maria Jasinskas was right & would have been if not for Pharmacy; She said, "You know sometimes Vyvanse can make you depressed"

352974009723387906	Y	Anyone on cymbalta it is making me like a zombie and still hating the world.
353102470534279169	Y	@LilythePurr I've had too much quetiapine today - I'm zombified.
353158902520619010	Y	i have been on lorazepam / diazepam / quetiapine for the past few nights and i've noticed i am slightly drooling a bit. lovely.
353176251315388416	Y	All I have to say is Cipro will mess you up kids. Don't get sick! #blagh #gross #weak
353360876373409795	Y	Well my effexor kinda did its job to keep my anxiety under control.... but now to get my heart rate down..... ugh
353449992440123395	Y	@mewtopia ...face. And quetiapine slightly increases sun sensitivity too.
353477521070751744	Y	whilst most kids ask santa for xmas presents, I'm like, can we reduce my quetiapine intake, I need to get out of bed
353629216518057984	Y	@catthoma Right, some SSRIs are used for cataplexy, as is Effexor. Can be tricky to wean off without rebound. #nchat
353836819030360064	Y	@Holeri81 Crippled since Oct of '09 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills here...run for your life! Tendon rupture is only the tip of the iceberg.
353854998825795586	Y	@DoctorMcPA Had my doctor attempted to treat with bactrim prior to Cipro, I wouldn't be crippled today.
354004406896828416	Y	quetiapine side affects are increased appetite and cravings. it all makes sense. 
354265959877443586	Y	Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol
354292834351857666	Y	@Sombrera The only medication (of which I am aware...and I know almost all of them) that has a regular headache side-effect is lamictal.
354334544473751552	Y	Since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous & my bras so expensive, I want a lingerie component to DLA.

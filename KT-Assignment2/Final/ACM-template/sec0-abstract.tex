In this report, we discuss effectiveness of machine learning  algorithms on the problem of tweets containing adverse drug reactions. Firstly, discuss the feature engineering, text normalisation. Then we transition into the analysis phase of the methods, while trying to understand their theoretical differences. We review several machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree. Further, we perform a critical analysis of another study with a similar problem.

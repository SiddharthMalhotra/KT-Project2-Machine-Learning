Capturing of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) is of significance importance for multiple reason. The most important being it going unnoticed and thus leading to medical complications. Secondly, this data may not be available elsewhere and offers a valuable perspective. Natural language processing is certainly a challenging task due to the unstructured and informal nature of text. Additionally the complication nature of drugs and their indications is tough to judge. In this paper our focus is on a.set of tweets provided to us. With substantial pre-processing, feature engineering, vector space creation; we attempt to critically evaluate different machine learning algorithms.
